# First Portfolio Website

This was the first portfolio site built from scratch with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it was the first place where others could see my work in a structured way.

## Project Overview

The site is a single-page portfolio with sections for projects, about, and contact. Navigation is handled client-side: clicking different sections updates the visible content without reloading the page, creating a simple SPA-like experience using only vanilla JavaScript. This project represents an important milestone in turning basic web skills into something complete and publicly usable.

## Key Features

- **Custom Navigation**: A JavaScript-driven navigation system that shows and hides sections dynamically without page reloads.
- **Interactive Project Section**: Expandable project entries so visitors can reveal more details on demand.
- **Responsive Layout**: CSS media queries and flexible layouts to make the site usable on both desktop and mobile.
- **Smooth Visuals**: Hover effects, transitions, shadows, and transforms to make interactions feel more polished.

## Technical Implementation

- **HTML & Structure**: Semantic sections for content, with clear separation of navigation, projects, and about information.
- **CSS & Layout**: Flexbox-based layout, use of viewport units for scalable typography, and iterative styling to get spacing and alignment right.
- **JavaScript Logic**: DOM manipulation and event listeners to toggle sections, handle project expansion, and update styles based on user interaction.

## Challenges & What I Learned

Styling was the hardest part: there was a lot of trial and error, repeatedly adding and removing CSS until elements looked and behaved as intended. That process taught careful use of flexbox, responsive units, and how small changes in CSS can affect the entire layout. This project now serves as a snapshot of where I started and how my approach to structure, design, and code quality has evolved.
