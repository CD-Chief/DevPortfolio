# AI Hunter

AI Hunter was built at one of my first hackathons in Sheffield as part of a team of four. The idea I proposed was a game where an AI-controlled hunter adapts to the player's movements and strategies while trying to catch them on a simple 2D map.

## Project Overview

The core mechanic is an AI that learns from the player's movement patterns and adjusts its chasing behavior over time. The game world is represented as a grid, with black blocks as walls, green as the player, light red as the hunter, and dark red as doors. We initially planned extra mechanics such as items (for example, flashbangs) to help the player escape, but within the hackathon timeframe we focused on getting the adaptive chasing behavior working.

## Key Features

- **Adaptive AI Behavior**: The hunter responds to how the player moves, rather than following a fixed path.
- **Real-Time Pursuit**: Player and hunter move in real time, with the AI updating its behavior as it gathers more information.
